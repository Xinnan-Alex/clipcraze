Clipcraze a youtube clone built using spring-boot as backend and angular as frontend.

This project is built for me to learn spring-boot and angular.

Things I learnt so far:

1. Using lombok to reduce boilerplate code (Constructor,Getter and Setters)
2. Using Spring AWS 3.X to upload video/image to S3 Bucket
3. Inject AWS access/secret key using VM Options (Purpose: to avoid exposing API keys to Repo)

Challenges I faced:

1. Video tutorial is Outdated which using AWS Spring 2.x, spend sometime to look into the docs and use the latest
   version which is 3.X

Below are the diagrams for the project.
